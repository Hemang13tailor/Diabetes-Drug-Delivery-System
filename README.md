# Diabetes-Drug-Delivery-System

## Overview
This project aims to develop a **MATLAB/Simulink-based Drug Delivery System** for **Type-1 Diabetes**. The system is modeled using **physics-based equations in Simulink**, followed by **system identification** to create first-order and second-order models. The identified models are validated using different datasets. Finally, a **control system** is designed to address both **disturbance rejection** and **setpoint regulation** problems.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Simulation Software**: MATLAB and Simulink
- **Modeling Techniques**: First-order and second order modeling, stability criteria
- **Control Design**: Proportional, Integral, and Derivative (PID) control methods

## Expected Results
- Accurate system identification of the drug delivery system.
- A robust control system that effectively manages drug dosage.

## Future Work
- Optimizing control strategies.
- Implementing adaptive control methods.
- Real-time simulation with patient data.
